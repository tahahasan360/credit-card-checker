Project Descriptions 

#credit.c
uses the Luhn algorithm to detect fraud and avoid unnecessarily checking against the company database for every potentially fraudulent credit card number. Also detects common credit card numbers and outputs their company name e.g. AMEX = American Express 

#readability.c
calculates the Coleman-Liau index of a text to detect its reading level.

#vigenere.c
takes a polyalphabetic key as a command-line argument and prompts the user to input the plaintext. Encrypts using the Vigenere cipher and outputs the ciphertext. Rejects non-alphabetic keys.

#substitution.c
takes a 26-character polyalphabetic key (rejects if any characters repeated or characters not alphabetic) and prompts the user to input the plaintext. Encrypts using the substitution cipher and outputs the ciphertext.
